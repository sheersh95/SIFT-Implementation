# SIFT-Implementation

Implemented SIFT Algorithm using basic python functions to obtain kepoints on any image. I have used 5 octaves and the scaling of each image is done by half in each octave.

Note: The code does not give the exact same output as given by the SIFT library function but it is close enough.
